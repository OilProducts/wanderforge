ME:  I want to make a voxel game, but the voxels will be small...ballpark 2cm cubes (maybe smaller).  Please do a survey of potential ways I might approach this.

AI:  Below is a fast, realistic survey of ways to build a *very‑fine* voxel game (\~2 cm voxels). I’ll give you options, when each shines, the core algorithms & data structures, and concrete implementation notes so you can pick a direction and prototype.

---

## First: sanity check (2 cm is tiny)

At 2 cm/voxel, even small spaces explode in voxel count:

| Bounded volume | Voxels (each axis) |        Total voxels | 1 bit/voxel | 1 byte/voxel |
| -------------- | -----------------: | ------------------: | ----------: | -----------: |
| 10 m cube      |                500 |         125,000,000 |   \~14.9 MB |     \~119 MB |
| 100 m cube     |              5,000 |     125,000,000,000 |   \~14.6 GB |     \~116 GB |
| 1 km cube      |             50,000 | 125,000,000,000,000 |   \~14.2 TB |     \~114 TB |

**Implication:** you’ll need sparsity, chunking/streaming, and aggressive meshing/LOD. Don’t plan for dense grids beyond a few meters without compression.

---

## Approach A — Meshed block world (grid → triangles)

**What:** Store voxels in chunks (e.g., 32³/64³), run a mesher to generate surface triangles, draw the mesh.
**When it shines:** “Blocky” art; lots of edits; simple physics; fast iteration.

**Algorithms & building blocks**

* **Face culling + Greedy meshing**: merge coplanar faces → huge triangle reduction. Excellent for micro‑blocks. Start here if you want the classic block look. ([0 FPS][1], [Gedge][2])
* **Material handling**: palette per chunk + RLE/bitmask compression; triplanar texturing to avoid UV seams; texture splatting for blended ground materials. ([Wikipedia][3])

**Chunk sizing reality at 2 cm**

* 32³ = 0.64 m cube, \~32 KB/chunk (1 byte/voxel)
* 64³ = 1.28 m, \~256 KB
* 128³ = 2.56 m, \~2 MB
  Small physical spans mean *lots* of chunks; group them for batching and stream by distance.

**Pros**

* Simple, robust, great with runtime edits.
* Very fast once meshed; meshes work with standard engines & physics.

**Cons**

* Curved/smooth features look stair‑stepped unless you go to tiny voxels (which hurts memory) or switch to a smooth mesher.
* LOD is non‑trivial (cracks) unless you add transition logic.

**References / examples**

* Greedy meshing overview and implementation notes. ([0 FPS][1], [Gedge][2])

---

## Approach B — Smooth isosurfaces (SDF/implicit) + meshing

**What:** Treat voxel data as a scalar field (density/TSDF). Extract a smooth surface via isosurface algorithms.

**Algorithms**

* **Marching Cubes (MC)**: long‑standing baseline for isosurface extraction. ([U of T Computer Science][4])
* **Transvoxel**: stitches MC meshes across **different LOD levels** seamlessly (solves cracks). Use this if you want big worlds with LOD. ([Transvoxel][5])
* **Dual Contouring (DC) + Manifold DC**: preserves *sharp features* (creases) via Hermite data and QEF minimization; works well on adaptive octrees. Great for crisp micro‑detail. ([Stanford Graphics][6], [WashU Computer Science][7])

**Data structures**

* Uniform grid near the camera; **adaptive octree** beyond (refine only near surfaces).
* **Hashed voxel grids / Voxel Hashing** for dynamic TSDFs & local edits with sparse memory. ([Niessner Lab][8])

**Pros**

* Smooth, high‑quality surfaces from coarse data; natural LOD; feature‑preserving with DC.
* Good for destructible terrain with caves, overhangs, etc.

**Cons**

* Implementations are more complex (QEFs, octree LOD, crack fixing).
* Runtime meshing cost; you’ll want compute‑driven pipelines and careful chunk scheduling.

**References / examples**

* Marching Cubes original paper. ([U of T Computer Science][4])
* Transvoxel overview and data tables. ([Transvoxel][5])
* Dual Contouring (Hermite) and Manifold DC. ([Stanford Graphics][6], [WashU Computer Science][7])
* Unity GPU DC demo with infinite LOD (good to study). ([GitHub][9])

---

## Approach C — Sparse Voxel Octrees (SVO): render or extract

**What:** Represent the world as a **hierarchical sparse voxel structure** (octree). Render by ray tracing/casting the SVO, or extract mesh fragments from it.

**When it shines:** Very large, mostly empty spaces; view‑dependent streaming; GI research; static or lightly‑dynamic content.

* Efficient SVO fundamentals & tradeoffs. ([NVIDIA][10])
* **GigaVoxels / Ray‑guided streaming**: stream only the nodes needed for the current view. Useful for huge scenes with micro detail. ([ResearchGate][11])
* **Voxel Cone Tracing (VCT)** for GI uses a hierarchical voxel structure; useful background if you plan voxel GI. ([NVIDIA][12])

**Pros**

* Strong memory scaling (empty‑space skipping).
* Built‑in multiresolution → natural LOD & mip‑like filtering.

**Cons**

* Dynamic editing and rebuilds are hard.
* Ray tracing an SVO for *gameplay* is still niche; hardware RT helps, but tooling is thinner than triangle meshes.

---

## Approach D — Direct volume rendering (ray marching / 3D textures)

**What:** Render the volume directly (no meshing) via ray marching through a dense or sparse 3D texture (or a brick pool/clipmap).
**When it shines:** Small, bounded volumes (smoke, fluids, small indoor scenes) or stylized visuals.

**Make it scale**

* Use **sparse/tiled 3D textures** (D3D “Volume Tiled Resources”; Vulkan “Sparse Images”) so you only allocate resident pages where needed. ([Microsoft Learn][13], [Vulkan Docs][14])
* Engine support exists (e.g., **Sparse Volume Textures** in Unreal). ([Epic Games Developers][15])
* Production libraries: **OpenVDB** for sparse volumes; **NanoVDB** and **GVDB** for GPU traversal & rendering. ([OpenVDB][16], [NVIDIA Developer][17], [GitHub][18])

**Pros**

* Zero meshing; continuous shading; clean LOD via mip‑hierarchies/clipmaps.
* Great for volumetric effects; workable for small static worlds.

**Cons**

* Harder to get crisp solid surfaces and robust collisions.
* Bandwidth‑bound; editing & collision often means maintaining an SDF and separate gameplay proxies.

---

## Approach E — Hybrid: “voxels for editing, triangles for play”

**What:** Author/store the world as voxels/SDF; **bake or stream** triangle meshes for runtime.
**When it shines:** You want tiny voxel detail but also want engine features (Nanite/Lumen/standard physics) to “just work.”

**How**

* Keep a voxel/SDF source of truth (procedural nodes + edits).
* Generate **meshlets** per region (compute shader), feed them to modern **mesh shaders** for efficient culling and draw‑submission. ([Microsoft GitHub][19], [GPUOpen][20])
* Use DC/MC near the player; coarser LOD far away (Transvoxel to stitch). ([Transvoxel][5])

**Pros**

* Best of both worlds: high visual quality with standard engine tooling.
* Edits accumulate as sparse deltas; only local remesh.

**Cons**

* More moving parts (generators + cookers + streamers).
* Build time and streaming pipeline complexity.

---

## Engines & libraries you can stand on (2025)

* **Unreal Engine 5 + Voxel Plugin**
  Robust runtime terrain editing, procedural graphs, large‑world integration; works with **Lumen** for dynamic GI. If you prefer triangle output with powerful tooling, this is a head start. ([Voxel Plugin][21], [Voxel Plugin Documentation][22], [Epic Games Developers][23])
* **Godot 4 + Zylann’s Voxel Tools**
  Open‑source, supports blocky and smooth terrains with LOD, streaming, and works alongside **SDFGI** for global illumination. Great for custom pipelines. ([GitHub][24], [Voxel Tools][25], [Godot Documentation][26])
* **OpenVDB/NanoVDB, NVIDIA GVDB**
  If you go lower‑level (C++/CUDA) for sparse volume storage and GPU traversal. Useful for D and C above. ([OpenVDB][16], [NVIDIA Developer][17], [GitHub][18])
* **Unity**
  Roll your own with compute + Entities. There are public examples of **GPU Dual Contouring** with infinite procedural LOD to study. ([GitHub][9])

---

## Picking a path (decision cheatsheet)

* **Blocky micro‑bricks builder?** → **A (Greedy meshing)** with chunk compression. Add LOD later (Transvoxel if you smooth). ([0 FPS][1])
* **Smooth, destructible terrain with caves; large but editable world?** → **B (SDF + DC/Transvoxel on an adaptive structure)**. Use hashed grids near the player and octree LOD beyond. ([Stanford Graphics][6], [Transvoxel][5], [Niessner Lab][8])
* **Mostly static, huge, super‑detailed vistas?** → **C or D** (SVO or sparse volume rendering) and stream aggressively; extract meshes for gameplay colliders as needed. ([NVIDIA][10], [ResearchGate][11])
* **I want tiny details but standard engine lighting/physics** → **E (Hybrid)**: voxel authoring → streamed triangle meshlets; let Nanite/Lumen/SDFGI do the heavy lifting. ([Microsoft GitHub][19], [Epic Games Developers][23], [Godot Documentation][26])

---

## Practical notes (performance, memory, and editing)

1. **Chunk size & batching**

  * Start with **64³** chunks (1.28 m). Group into “region meshes” to keep draw calls low. Keep each mesh under 65 k vertices if you want 16‑bit indices.
2. **Compression**

  * Palette + RLE per chunk; delta‑encode edits; keep a separate “air mask” (bitset) to accelerate greedy meshing.
3. **Meshing pipeline**

  * CPU meshing is fine to start; move to **compute‑shader meshing** (append buffers + prefix sums) as scenes scale.
  * **Transvoxel** to stitch LODs; **Dual Contouring** for sharp edges. ([Transvoxel][5], [Stanford Graphics][6])
4. **Storage & streaming**

  * Treat chunks like virtual pages; stream by distance & importance. If using volume rendering, prefer **sparse/tiled 3D textures** to avoid allocating empty space. ([Microsoft Learn][13], [Vulkan Docs][14])
5. **Lighting**

  * UE5 **Lumen** or Godot **SDFGI** pair well with meshed output (A/B/E). For pure volumes (D), look at emissive fields + volume ray marching, or voxel‑based GI like **VCT** for research prototypes. ([Epic Games Developers][23], [Godot Documentation][26], [NVIDIA][12])
6. **Physics/collision**

  * Prefer **triangle colliders** from your mesher; update locally after edits. For smooth SDF worlds, you can sample the SDF for robust collision (ray–SDF, swept volumes), but it’s more custom.

---

## Prototype recipes (1–2 weeks each)

**Recipe 1 — Micro‑block sandbox (fastest to see results)**

1. 64³ chunks, palette + air mask.
2. Greedy mesher + triplanar; frustum + occlusion culling.
3. Disk format: region files of chunk blobs.
4. Simple edit tools (paint/dig). ([0 FPS][1])

**Recipe 2 — Smooth terrain with LOD and edits**

1. Scalar field (noise + stamps) → **MC** meshing.
2. Swap in **Transvoxel** for LOD seams; move to **DC** for sharp features.
3. Adaptive octree near surfaces + hashed grids for edits. ([U of T Computer Science][4], [Transvoxel][5], [Stanford Graphics][6])

**Recipe 3 — Sparse volume renderer (stylized/small‑scene)**

1. Sparse 3D texture or OpenVDB → **NanoVDB/GVDB** on GPU.
2. Clipmaps/mips for LOD; simple SDF collisions for gameplay proxies. ([NVIDIA Developer][17], [GitHub][18])

---

## Common pitfalls to avoid

* **Dense grids everywhere.** At 2 cm, always assume sparsity.
* **Too‑large chunks.** 256³ is \~5.12 m at 2 cm but \~16 MB raw/chunk (1 byte/voxel) before compression; editing/remeshing will stutter.
* **LOD cracks.** Use Transvoxel or octree‑aware DC. ([Transvoxel][5], [WashU Computer Science][7])
* **Draw‑call storms.** Batch chunks, consider **mesh shaders/meshlets** on modern GPUs. ([Microsoft GitHub][19], [GPUOpen][20])

---

## If you want specific suggestions next

A few answers will lock this down:

* **Look**: blocky micro‑bricks or smooth/curved?
* **World scale**: room/building, open terrain, planetary?
* **Editing**: light/moderate/heavy at runtime?
* **Target platforms**: mid‑range PC? Consoles? Mobile?
* **Engine**: Unreal / Godot / Unity / custom?

Give me that and I’ll turn this into a concrete, step‑by‑step build plan (chunk sizes, mesher choice, data formats, and a performance budget).

ME:  This is for me, I want to target my own PC which is fairly high end.  9800x3d and a 4090 GPU.  How does/did minecraft handle the problem, doesn't it have an "infinite" world?

AI:  Short answer: **Minecraft feels “infinite” because it only *keeps* a tiny slice of the world in memory, and it *creates/saves* terrain in small pieces on demand.** It’s big—but not literally infinite.

Below is how it works and what you can borrow for your 2 cm‑voxel project.

---

## The core idea: chunks + streaming

* **Unit scale & grid.** Minecraft’s world is a grid of 1 m cubes (“blocks”). The world is partitioned into **chunks** that are **16×16 blocks** across and (in modern Java Edition Overworld) **384 blocks tall**. Each chunk is internally split into **16×16×16 “sections”** for culling/IO. ([Minecraft Wiki][1])

* **Only nearby chunks are loaded.** The client shows chunks out to your **render distance**; the server (or single‑player server thread) *ticks* game logic in a smaller square region called **simulation distance**. E.g., a sim distance of 6 means entities and most updates run in a **13×13 chunk** square around the player; one ring beyond that is “border” with limited updates, and then nothing. Java uses a **ticket system** to request/generate/unload chunk columns as needed. ([Minecraft Wiki][2])

* **Persistent storage is tiled.** On disk, Minecraft groups chunks into **region files** (`.mca`), each covering **32×32 chunk columns** (i.e., a 512×512‑block tile). Inside each chunk, data are stored in NBT with **paletted block states per 16×16×16 section** (plus skylight/block‑light arrays, etc.). ([Minecraft Wiki][3])

---

## “Infinite” (but actually bounded)

* The world is *procedurally generated* from a **seed**; with the same seed and version, any chunk will always generate the same way. New chunks are generated the first time you approach them and then saved to disk. ([Minecraft Wiki][4])
* In Java Edition there’s a **world border at X/Z ±29,999,984**; chunks may exist past that, but players can’t cross ±30 million blocks without hacks. Older versions had the **“Far Lands”** bug around **±12,550,821** due to noise math overflow, long since removed. So: effectively enormous, not infinite. ([Minecraft Wiki][5], [Minecraft Archive][6])

---

## Rendering & updates (the practical bits)

* **Chunk meshing.** Vanilla builds a mesh for each chunk section and **culls faces** that touch opaque neighbors, then batches by material/face orientation. (Lots of clones add **greedy meshing** to merge coplanar faces; it’s not required for correctness, just fewer triangles.) Lighting uses **0–15 light levels** per block; skylight and block‑light are stored per section and updated incrementally. ([Minecraft Wiki][7])

* **Generation & IO pipeline.** Generation proceeds in steps (biomes, noise, surface, features, light, etc.); the **ticket system** asks for the step it needs (pathfinding, mob spawn, collision), and chunks are saved/evicted when not referenced. ([Minecraft Wiki][7])

---

## How Minecraft maps coordinates → files (copy‑pasteable logic)

```text
// World → chunk
chunkX  = floor(worldX / 16)
chunkZ  = floor(worldZ / 16)
inChunkX = worldX & 15           // == worldX mod 16
inChunkZ = worldZ & 15
sectionY = floor(worldY / 16)    // e.g., -4..+19 in a 384-high Overworld

// Chunk → region file
regionX = floor(chunkX / 32)
regionZ = floor(chunkZ / 32)
// file name: r.<regionX>.<regionZ>.mca  (each file covers 32×32 chunks)
```

That’s exactly how `.mca` tiling keeps disk usage sane and lets the game stream just the pieces you need. ([Minecraft Wiki][3])

---

## What to lift for your 2 cm‑voxel game (on your 9800X3D + 4090)

1. **Keep Minecraft’s tiling discipline.**
   16×16 *block* chunks at 1 m are \~16 m wide. At **2 cm voxels**, you’ll want physically larger chunks (e.g., **64³ or 128³ voxels**) so you’re not juggling millions of tiny chunks. Still store/save them **region‑style** (e.g., 16×16 chunks per region file).

2. **Separate visibility from simulation.**
   Adopt **render distance vs. simulation distance** knobs. Your CPU (9800X3D) can tick a smaller window aggressively while the 4090 draws a larger vista. ([Minecraft Wiki][2])

3. **Palettes + compressed sections.**
   Use paletted block states per sub‑chunk; this is a huge win for memory/bandwidth and makes edits local. ([Minecraft Wiki][7])

4. **Mesh per sub‑chunk, regenerate locally.**
   Rebuild only the edited section (and its neighbors). Start with face culling; consider greedy meshing later if triangle counts become your bottleneck.

---

### TL;DR

Minecraft’s “infinite” world is **chunked, streamed, and tiled on disk**. It **loads/ticks only what’s near you**, generates new chunks from a **seed** when needed, and enforces a **\~30 million‑block border** so arithmetic stays sane. The same playbook—chunks, render vs. sim distance, paletted sub‑chunks, and regional files—scales down perfectly to a fine‑grained voxel game; you’ll just pick chunk sizes that make sense at 2 cm resolution. ([Minecraft Wiki][4])

If you want, I can translate this into an initial file/format and runtime plan (chunk size, section layout, on‑disk region header, and a minimal mesher) tailored to 2 cm voxels.

ME: A bit more detail about this potential game.  I want to also take inspiration from falling sand games in that physics will apply to the voxels.  They also will interact with their neighbors, for example, via friction (ambitious goal) or reactivity (lava sets wood on fire).  Given this, and that I am fine with it only running on desktop class hardware, do you recommend any changes to the voxel size, and/or do you have a specific recommendation for the implementation given the compute requirements?  as for your questions...Look? Blocky is probably easier right? maybe curved but I'm not sure how the "falling sand" bit would work there, on the other hand, it might work better with curved rendering.  Scale?  procedurally generated, planetary scale. (I actually want it to be circular, with gravity)  Editing? I'm not sure what you mean by this. Engine? I'd prefer to keep everything in code.  But that's it, I'm not an artist and I don't know how to make 3d models, but I'm a proficient programmer in more than a few languages.

AI:  Great—targeting a 9800X3D + RTX 4090 gives you tons of headroom. With “falling‑sand‑style” **per‑voxel physics** (granular flow, heat, reactions) *and* a **planetary** world, the main challenge isn’t raw compute, it’s **domain size**. You can’t afford a dense 3D grid at 2 cm over anything but a small region. The key is to keep the world *sparse*, and simulate *only* “active” material in compact bubbles that move with the action.

Below is a concrete plan, with specific sizes, data structures, and an update pipeline you can start coding.

---

## TL;DR recommendations

* **Voxel size:**

  * Use **5 cm** voxels as the **default** resolution.
  * Allow **adaptive refinement to 2 cm** *inside small, active simulation islands* (lava spills, cave‑ins, explosions).
  * This preserves fine detail where physics are happening without blowing up memory everywhere.

* **Look:** Start **blocky**. Your CA (cellular automata) rules live on a cubic lattice; blocky meshes match that perfectly. If you want smoother visuals later, add a *view‑only* smooth mesher (dual contouring / marching cubes) **after** the CA is stable.

* **World scale (planet):**

  * Don’t store a planetary volume. Keep a **procedural SDF/height‑field** as the immutable “base world.”
  * Material edits/erosion/structures live in a **sparse delta store**.
  * Only maintain **dense 3D grids** (simulation islands) where stuff is moving/burning/reacting.

* **Compute model:**

  * Run the CA on the **GPU** (compute shaders or CUDA), *active set only*, in **tile‑local shared memory**.
  * Two‑phase “propose & commit” updates with conflict resolution via atomics or ticketing.

* **Chunking & streaming:**

  * Author/mesh the world with **64³** voxel chunks at 5 cm (3.2 m across).
  * Simulation islands are **dense volumes** (e.g., 10–20 m boxes) composed of those chunks, refined to 2 cm locally as needed.
  * Save/load chunks in **region files** (Minecraft‑style) plus a **sparse edit log**.

---

## Why not 2 cm everywhere?

At 2 cm, you have **50 voxels/m**; even a modest **10 m cube is 125 M cells**. That’s far beyond what you want to update every frame—even on a 4090. The trick is:

* **Static = implicit.** The base planet is procedural; you don’t store it voxel‑by‑voxel.
* **Dynamic = sparse.** Only voxels that are *non‑air* **and** near activity enter the simulation.
* **Local = dense.** Where activity happens, temporarily maintain a **dense brick** (e.g., 10–20 m) so the CA can read neighbors cheaply.

Think of it as *“sparse everywhere, dense where it matters.”*

---

## Concrete architecture

### 1) World representation

* **Base planet (read‑only, infinite feel):**

  * A **procedural SDF** or height‑field stack: continent noise → erosion passes → caves (3D noise) → biome masks → initial materials (rock, soil, ore pockets, water, lava).
  * Query function: `Material sample_base(Int3 p)` returns `{type, density, temp}` from seed + version.

* **Delta store (edits):**

  * **Hashed sparse voxels**, key = `(x,y,z)` (or chunk key + local index).
  * Value = `{material_id:16, temp:12, flags:4}` packed into 32–64 bits.
  * Supports: set/add/remove, range queries, iteration by chunk.

* **Runtime chunks (for meshing & culling):**

  * **64×64×64** at 5 cm (3.2 m cube).
  * Backed by: small **palette** + **bitmasks** (air/solid/fluid), optional **RLE** for long runs.
  * Mesh on demand (greedy meshing for blocky; optional smooth mesher later).

### 2) Simulation islands (falling‑sand physics)

* Each island is a **dense 3D grid** that follows activity:

  * Typical sizes: **10 m → 200³ cells (at 5 cm) = 8 M cells**, OK on a 4090 if you keep state lean.
  * If the action is very tight (lava stream, sand collapse), refine a **nested 2 cm subgrid** in a smaller inner window (e.g., 4–8 m cube).
* **Migration:** If activity approaches the island edge, spawn/merge a neighbor island and retire calm regions back into the sparse delta store.
* **Bake‑out:** When an island calms (no active voxels), compress its state back into chunk deltas, discard the dense buffer.

### 3) Data layout (inside a dense island)

Use **8×8×8 tiles** (512 cells) to exploit shared memory and bit tricks:

* **Per‑tile header (few hundred bytes):**

  * `uint64 occupancy[8]` (512 bits) → *is there a voxel here?*
  * `uint64 solid_mask[8]`, `uint64 fluid_mask[8]` (optional if you split by type)
  * A small **material palette** (<= 32) + per‑cell **palette index** (5 bits)
    → Store per‑cell index in a **packed 512×5‑bit array** (320 bytes)
  * Optional **temperature** as 8‑bit (or 12‑bit packed) per cell.
  * Optional **momentum/vel**: 3×int8 or a 6‑bit direction + 2‑bit magnitude (very compact).

* **Global arrays:**

  * `active_list` (append/consume buffer of cell indices to update this tick)
  * `next_active_list` (cells activated by this tick)
  * `move_requests` (scatter buffer for proposed moves)
  * `rng_state` per tile (for stochastic rules, e.g., sand chooses L/R move randomly)

**Memory budget example (island = 200³ @ 5 cm):**

* Cells = **8.0 M**.
* If you store \~4 bytes/cell (palette index + temp + flags) → \~32 MB.
* Add a velocity byte and a few staging buffers → \~64–128 MB total. Very manageable on a 24 GB GPU.

### 4) Update pipeline (GPU)

1. **Active set build (cheap pre‑pass):**

  * Active if: non‑air **and** (neighbor is air/fluid **or** temp change **or** unbalanced support)
  * Also include neighbors of last tick’s active cells.

2. **Tile‑local simulate (compute shader):**

  * **Load tile** into shared memory (bitmasks + small arrays).
  * For each active cell, apply **rules**:

    * **Granular (sand/soil):** try `(down)`, then `(down±x)`/`(down±y)`, else **slope flow** if local height gradient > angle‑of‑repose (encodes friction).
    * **Liquids:** downward if empty; else spread sideways with limited “pressure” per step; mix with neighboring liquids by density.
    * **Gases:** diffuse rapidly; buoyancy opposite gravity.
    * **Thermal:** diffuse temperature; if `temp > flashpoint` and neighbor is combustible → ignite; lava cools against water → stone.
    * **Chemistry:** rule table keyed by `{matA, matB}` with probability, temperature, and state filters.
  * **Propose moves** into `move_requests` (one per cell max), including **priority** (e.g., gravity first, then lateral).
  * **Commit phase:** process requests in deterministic order; use **atomicCAS** on destination occupancy bits; losers re‑queue or stay.

3. **Refinement bubble (optional):**

  * If a tile exceeds a “complexity” threshold (lots of conflicting moves or dense flows), **subdivide to 2 cm** locally: create a 2 cm sub‑tile that replaces the 5 cm tile logically; map materials and velocities; simulate at finer resolution; periodically re‑aggregate to 5 cm.

4. **Island management:**

  * If no cells touched for N ticks, **bake** back to chunks and release buffers.
  * If frontier activity detected, **grow** the island (allocate neighbor tiles) and pull needed base‑world voxels from SDF/deltas.

**Scheduling tips**

* Use **checkerboard updates** (two color sets) to reduce conflicts.
* Keep **branchless** hot loops where possible; push material‑specific logic into tables/bitmasks.
* Favor **structure‑of‑arrays** (SoA) for coalesced memory access.

---

## Rendering & collision

* **Meshes from voxels:** Start with **face‑culling + greedy meshing** per 64³ chunk. Fast and simple.
* **LOD:** Keep a quadtree/clipmap at the *visual* level (not in the CA). Stitch LODs with skirts or a transition mesher later.
* **Smooth look (optional later):** Run **dual contouring** on the chunk field for rock/soil while keeping fluids as voxel sheets or metaballs. Your CA still runs on the grid; meshes are just presentation.
* **Collision:** Use the **meshes** for rigid‑body collisions. For fluid/particle gameplay interactions, ray or sample into the **island grid** directly.

---

## Gravity and “circular/planetary”

* Keep **world coordinates Euclidean**; gravity is `g = -normalize(p - planet_center) * g0`.
* Far‑field terrain (kilometers) is a **height‑mapped sphere** (cube‑sphere projection) you only *render*.
* Near the player, **voxelize a shell** around the surface (e.g., ±8–12 m) by sampling your base SDF + deltas into chunks. This shell feeds both the mesh and any islands you spin up for physics.
* Because everything is local, neighbor relations remain standard 3D grid—even on a curved planet.

---

## Material model (minimal but extensible)

```txt
struct Material {
  uint8  kind;        // 0=air,1=solid,2=granular,3=liquid,4=gas
  uint8  density;     // relative 0..255
  uint8  friction;    // 0..255 => angle of repose or slip factor
  uint8  combust;     // 0..255 => ease of ignition
  uint8  melting;     // temperature threshold
  uint8  boiling;     // temperature threshold
  uint8  reactivity_id; // index into a small reaction table
  uint8  flags;       // e.g., buoyant, sticky, corrosive
}
```

* **Angle‑of‑repose**: map `friction` to a slope threshold; sand flows when local slope > threshold.
* **Temperature**: 1 byte is enough if you choose a scale (e.g., 0–255 → 0–2000 °C).
* **Reactions**: a compact table: `(A,B, temp_min, temp_max, prob, product, heat_delta, state_change)`.

---

## What “editing” means here

* *Editing* = any runtime change to the world: digging, placing blocks, fluid deposition, heat transfer, chemistry—*your CA itself is “editing”*.
* Implementation detail: edits land in the **delta store** and optionally trigger or enlarge a **simulation island**; nearby chunks are **re‑meshed**.

---

## Engine/tooling choices (code‑first)

* **Compute & graphics in one API** (simplest):

  * **Vulkan** (C++ or Rust via `wgpu`) with compute shaders.
  * Pros: one memory space, easy buffer sharing; still portable if you ever want it.
* **CUDA + graphics interop** (NVIDIA‑only, fastest dev for CA):

  * CUDA for the CA; Vulkan/GL/DX for rendering; share buffers via interop.
  * Your 4090 will love this; you can write the CA like a HPC kernel and keep rendering separate.

If you’re comfortable with C++: Vulkan + GLSL/HLSL compute is a good balance. If you want the most ergonomic GPU code on NVIDIA, CUDA kernels are hard to beat.

---

## A first, realistic milestone (4–6 weeks)

1. **World plumbing**

  * Base SDF/height function with materials; 64³ chunk cache; greedy mesher; simple triplanar textures.
2. **Delta store**

  * Hashed voxel map; per‑chunk palettes; save/load to region files.
3. **One simulation island (5 cm only)**

  * 10 m cube (200³ = 8 M cells) dense buffer + active lists.
  * GPU CA with sand + water + lava + wood + fire, thermal diffusion, ignition rules.
  * Two‑phase update (propose, commit), checkerboard scheduling.
4. **Bake‑out + mesh refresh**

  * When calm, write island back to deltas; re‑mesh touched chunks.
5. **Gravity**

  * Radial gravity; island follows the surface normal; player can walk around a small “mini‑planet.”

**Stretch:** 2 cm refinement bubble inside the island; liquids mix; lava → stone on contact with water.

---

## Sanity‑check numbers

* **200³ island @ 5 cm**

  * 8 M cells × \~4–8 B/cell core state = 32–64 MB + staging → \~128 MB on GPU.
  * With efficient culling, \~1–3 M *active* cells per tick is typical; 4090 can comfortably process that at 60 Hz if your kernel is memory‑coherent and tile‑local.
* **Meshes**

  * A 64³ chunk often meshes to **<10k tris** with greedy meshing in natural terrain; **GPU mesh build** amortizes well across frames.

---

## Answering your open questions directly

* **Should I change voxel size?**
  Yes: make **5 cm** your baseline; drop to **2 cm** *only* where the physics need it (small refinement bubbles). Pure 2 cm everywhere isn’t tenable at planetary scope.

* **Blocky vs curved?**
  **Start blocky.** It aligns with the CA grid and is easier to debug. You can add a smooth, view‑only mesher later without changing the simulation.

* **“Editing”—what is it?**
  Any runtime change (digging, flowing, burning). Practically: a write to the delta store + a local re‑mesh. Your CA *is* an editor.

* **Planetary + gravity?**
  Keep the planet procedural and implicit. Voxelize only a local shell + simulation islands; gravity is radial, so the CA rules are unchanged.

---

If you want, I can sketch the **minimal data structures** (C++/CUDA or Vulkan) and a **toy kernel** for the 3D sand/water/lava rules—plus a tiny file format for region + chunk + delta.


ME:  I love it.  Seeing the numbers laid out like that though, it does give me pause reconsidering the level of detail.  How about we re-evaluate with 10cm scale voxels for all the main elements, but plan on adding smaller multiples for future expansion/adding materials.  So 10cm for dirt, wood, stone, maybe in the future with things that are more rare or that need finer simulation run them at 5cm or 2.5cm so they fit within the grid as multiples.  How does that sound?  Can you come up with a project roadmap with a lot of detail?  Regarding tech stack/technology, lets go with C++/Vulkan.  I like the idea of writing raw cuda but honestly, its one of the few things I don't have much experience with.  I like all of the other ideas you had but I want to also scale down what I mean by "planetary"  A user should be able to circumnavigate in 20 minutes of "running"  so that puts an upper bound on the planet size.

As far as "minimal data structures" and a toy kernel for the 3d sand/water/lava rules, yes please, but do that *after* writing up the detailed roadmap.


AI:  That plan sounds solid. Moving the **baseline to 10 cm** voxels for all common materials and reserving **5 cm / 2.5 cm** “micro‑tiers” for rare/fine simulations keeps your compute and memory under control—while leaving a clear expansion path.

Below is a detailed **project roadmap** for a C++/Vulkan implementation, sized to your “20‑minute circumnavigation” planet, followed by **minimal data structures** and a **toy compute kernel** (GLSL) for sand/water/lava.

---

## 0) Quick scale math (to size budgets)

Let `t = 20 min = 1,200 s`. Circumference `C = v * t`, radius `R = C / (2π)`. Equator voxels = `C / 0.1 m`.

| Run speed (m/s) | Circumference (m) | Radius (m) | Equator voxels (10 cm) | Equator chunks @ 64³ (6.4 m) |
| --------------: | ----------------: | ---------: | ---------------------: | ---------------------------: |
|               5 |             6,000 |      \~955 |                 60,000 |                        \~938 |
|               6 |             7,200 |    \~1,146 |                 72,000 |                      \~1,125 |
|               8 |             9,600 |    \~1,527 |                 96,000 |                      \~1,500 |

> Recommendation: assume **6 m/s** → **C ≈ 7.2 km**, **R ≈ 1.15 km**. You will **not** store the planet densely; you’ll stream/voxelize a **local shell** near the player and simulate **dense islands** only around activity.

---

## High‑level architecture (recap at 10 cm)

* **Base world:** procedural SDF/heightfield on a **cube‑sphere** with biomes/material IDs. Read‑only.
* **Delta store:** sparse edits (hash map keyed by chunk + local index). Authoritative for changes.
* **Chunks (visual/cache):** **64³ voxels** at 10 cm (**6.4 m** physical). Paletted + bitmasks. Meshed on demand.
* **Simulation islands:** dense 3D grids **12–16 m** per side (i.e., **120–160** cells at 10 cm → **1.7–4.1 M** cells), spawned where activity happens; optional nested **5 cm / 2.5 cm** refinement bubbles inside.

---

## Roadmap (phased, deliverables, budgets)

Each “phase” is \~1–3 weeks of focused work. Parallelize if you like, but the order minimizes rework.

### Phase 1 — Project skeleton & Vulkan plumbing (1–2 weeks)

**Deliverables**

* CMake skeleton, CI build.
* Vulkan instance/device selection, queues, debug layers.
* VMA (Vulkan Memory Allocator) integration, command pool/submit helpers.
* Shader toolchain (glslangValidator or DXC → SPIR‑V).
* Windowing (GLFW/SDL), swapchain & a simple full‑screen pass.

**Success criteria**

* Draw a test triangle and dispatch a trivial compute shader; hot‑reload shaders.

---

### Phase 2 — Math, planet frame & procedural base world (2 weeks)

**Deliverables**

* Math types (float3, int3, transforms); 64‑bit world coords.
* **Cube‑sphere mapping** utilities (face <-> direction vectors).
* Deterministic noise stack (FBM/Perlin/Simplex) for: elevation, caves, biome masks.
* **Base sampler**:

  ```cpp
  struct BaseSample { uint16_t material; float density; };
  BaseSample sample_base(Int3 voxel);
  ```

  Uses world‑to‑planet mapping; returns rock/soil/water/lava/air (no deltas yet).

**Success criteria**

* CPU tool to ray‑march planet surface; visualize a single ring of chunks around start.

---

### Phase 3 — Chunk store, palette & greedy meshing (2–3 weeks)

**Deliverables**

* **Chunk format**: 64³ voxels, split into **8×8×8 tiles** internally.

  * Per‑chunk: material palette (≤256), bitsets for air/solid/fluid, packed indices.
* **Region files** (Minecraft‑style): each region = **32×32 chunks** on a face‑local grid; TOC + compressed chunk blobs (zstd/LZ4).
* **Greedy mesher** (CPU first) → index/vertex buffers.
* **Renderer**: frustum culling, per‑material draw lists, triplanar texturing.

**Budget targets**

* Typical chunk after greedy meshing: **≤ 15k tris**.
* Mesh build: **< 1 ms** per dirty chunk on CPU (later move to compute).

**Success criteria**

* Walk around a static planet; streaming loads/unloads chunks around player smoothly at 60 fps.

---

### Phase 4 — Delta store & re‑meshing (1–2 weeks)

**Deliverables**

* Sparse **delta map**:

  ```cpp
  struct VoxelDelta { uint16_t mat; uint8_t temp; uint8_t flags; };
  // key = (chunk_key, local_index)
  ```
* Read path: `sample_world(voxel) = deltas.get(voxel).or_else(sample_base(voxel))`
* Write path: set/remove delta; mark affected chunk + neighbors dirty → re‑mesh.

**Success criteria**

* Tools to dig/place voxels; chunks re‑mesh locally; edits persist on save.

---

### Phase 5 — Simulation islands v1 (10 cm only) (2–3 weeks)

**Deliverables**

* **Island manager**: creates a dense box (e.g., **128³** or **160³**) centered on activity.
* **State layout per island** (GPU buffers):

  * Occupancy bitset (1 b/cell), material index (1 B), temperature (1 B), velocity/flags (1 B).
  * **Active list** buffers (ping‑pong), **move request** buffer.
* **Island<->world I/O**:

  * **Bake‑in**: sample base + deltas into island grids.
  * **Bake‑out**: write back only *changes* (deltas); enqueue chunk re‑mesh.

**Budget targets**

* Island memory (160³ \~ 4.1 M cells): **\~32–64 MB** plus staging.
* Transfer/bake each direction **< 2 ms** amortized (async DMA).

**Success criteria**

* Spawn an island when you pour material; after it calms (no active voxels for N ticks), it bakes out and disappears.

---

### Phase 6 — CA kernel v1: sand + water (2–3 weeks)

**Deliverables**

* Vulkan compute pipeline for **two‑phase** update:

  1. **Propose** moves per active cell (tile‑local in shared memory).
  2. **Commit** with atomic CAS on destination occupancy; losers re‑queue or stay.
* Rules:

  * **Sand**: try down → down‑left/right → slide if slope > threshold; sinks in water.
  * **Water**: down → lateral spread with limited outflow per tick.
* **Radial gravity**: `g = -normalize(p - center) * g0`.

**Budget targets**

* 1–2 M active cells/tick at 60 fps on your 4090 is realistic if memory‑coherent.

**Success criteria**

* Piles form with believable angle of repose; water fills and flows; sand displaces water.

---

### Phase 7 — Thermal + lava + fire (2 weeks)

**Deliverables**

* Temperature diffusion; per‑material thresholds: ignite, melt, solidify.
* **Lava**: viscous fluid + heat source; water contact → stone; wood → fire → ash.
* **Simple reaction table** (A,B → product, heatΔ, probability).

**Success criteria**

* Pour lava onto water → cooled stone on contact; wood near lava ignites and burns out.

---

### Phase 8 — Refinement bubbles (5 cm / 2.5 cm) (2–3 weeks)

**Deliverables**

* Per‑island **sub‑grid** refinement when local complexity high:

  * Allocate **2×** or **4×** finer sub‑box (e.g., 5 cm or 2.5 cm) for a small volume.
  * Map coarse cells into fine; simulate; periodically re‑aggregate down.
* Deterministic **mapping up/down** (majority material, volume‑weighted temp).

**Success criteria**

* Narrow flows (lava rivulets, fine grains) look better without exploding global cost.

---

### Phase 9 — Visual LOD & far‑field planet (1–2 weeks)

**Deliverables**

* **Far mesh**: low‑poly cube‑sphere with displacement from base elevation (no voxels).
* **Near/far transition**: blend radius; inside → chunked voxel meshes; outside → far mesh.
* **Chunk clipmap** for mid‑range if needed (optional).

**Success criteria**

* Stable 60 fps with a \~2–4 km view distance; minimal popping.

---

### Phase 10 — Save/Load, journaling, and robustness (1 week)

**Deliverables**

* Region index + chunk dirty bit tracking.
* **Delta journaling** (append log) → periodic compaction.
* Versioned world header & seed locking.

---

### Phase 11 — Tools & profiling (1 week initial, then ongoing)

**Deliverables**

* ImGui overlay: GPU timings, active cell counts, island list, memory usage.
* Heatmaps (active cells, temperature, slope).
* Determinism toggles (fixed RNG seed from cell coords + tick).

---

### Ongoing performance budgets (per frame)

* **CA compute**: 6–9 ms (depends on active cells).
* **Meshing (dirty chunks)**: 1–3 ms amortized (move to GPU compute later).
* **Rendering**: 4–6 ms (4090 with greedy meshes + triplanar is easy).
* **Streaming/IO**: async; keep under PCIe saturation; prefetch based on velocity.

---

## Key technical choices (why)

* **64³ chunks @ 10 cm** (6.4 m) give good batching. Internally, process **8³ tiles** in shared memory.
* **Simulation islands** decouple CA from world storage; only dense where needed.
* **Two‑phase CA** avoids write hazards; **checkerboard parity** reduces oscillations.
* **Palette + bitmasks** shrink memory and speed meshing.
* **Cube‑sphere** keeps distortion bounded for planet sampling; everything local remains a straight 3D grid.

---

## Minimal data structures (C++)

> These are lean, compile‑ready sketches to set the shape. Fill in I/O and safety as you build.

### Materials & utility

```cpp
// material ids are compact (<= 255 common materials)
enum Material : uint16_t {
  MAT_AIR = 0, MAT_ROCK, MAT_DIRT, MAT_WOOD, MAT_WATER, MAT_LAVA, MAT_FIRE, MAT_STONE,
  // ...
};

struct VoxelState {
  uint16_t mat;      // Material id (paletted in chunks)
  uint8_t  temp;     // 0..255 mapped to 0..Tmax
  uint8_t  flags;    // bit 0: solid, bit1: fluid, bit2: granular, etc.
};

inline bool is_air(uint16_t m)    { return m == MAT_AIR; }
inline bool is_fluid(uint16_t m)  { return m == MAT_WATER || m == MAT_LAVA; }
inline bool is_granular(uint16_t m){ return m == MAT_DIRT; }
```

### Bit‑packed index array (for paletted chunks)

```cpp
struct BitArray {
  uint32_t bits_per;  // 1,2,4,8
  uint32_t size;      // number of items
  std::vector<uint64_t> data;

  BitArray(uint32_t n, uint32_t bpp): bits_per(bpp), size(n),
    data((n * bpp + 63) / 64, 0ull) {}

  void set(uint32_t i, uint32_t v) {
    const uint64_t bit  = uint64_t(i) * bits_per;
    const uint32_t word = bit >> 6;
    const uint32_t off  = bit & 63;
    const uint64_t mask = ((1ull << bits_per) - 1ull) << off;
    data[word] = (data[word] & ~mask) | (uint64_t(v) << off);
    const uint32_t spill = (off + bits_per) > 64;
    if (spill) {
      const uint32_t w2 = word + 1;
      const uint32_t r  = 64 - off;
      const uint64_t mask2 = (1ull << (bits_per - r)) - 1ull;
      data[w2] = (data[w2] & ~mask2) | (uint64_t(v) >> r);
    }
  }

  uint32_t get(uint32_t i) const {
    const uint64_t bit  = uint64_t(i) * bits_per;
    const uint32_t word = bit >> 6;
    const uint32_t off  = bit & 63;
    uint64_t val = data[word] >> off;
    if ((off + bits_per) > 64) {
      val |= data[word + 1] << (64 - off);
    }
    return uint32_t(val & ((1ull << bits_per) - 1ull));
  }
};
```

### Chunk (64³) with palette + masks

```cpp
struct ChunkKey { int32_t cx, cy, cz; }; // 64-voxel steps in world space

struct Chunk64 {
  static constexpr int N = 64;
  static constexpr int N3 = N*N*N;

  // small palette (<= 256) for this chunk
  std::vector<uint16_t> palette;       // palette[index] -> material id
  std::unordered_map<uint16_t,uint16_t> palette_lut; // material->index
  BitArray indices;     // N3 entries, 1/2/4/8 bits per entry
  std::array<uint64_t, (N3+63)/64> occ;     // occupancy bitset (non-air)
  std::array<uint64_t, (N3+63)/64> fluid;   // fluids bitset (optional)
  std::array<uint64_t, (N3+63)/64> granular;// granular bitset (optional)
  bool dirty_mesh = true;

  Chunk64() : indices(N3, 8) { // start with 8 bpp; can shrink after building palette
    occ.fill(0); fluid.fill(0); granular.fill(0);
    palette.reserve(64);
  }

  uint16_t ensure_palette(uint16_t mat) {
    auto it = palette_lut.find(mat);
    if (it != palette_lut.end()) return it->second;
    uint16_t id = (uint16_t)palette.size();
    palette.push_back(mat);
    palette_lut.emplace(mat, id);
    return id;
  }

  static inline uint32_t lindex(int x,int y,int z) { return (z*N + y)*N + x; }

  void set_voxel(int x,int y,int z, uint16_t mat) {
    const uint32_t i = lindex(x,y,z);
    const uint16_t pi = ensure_palette(mat);
    indices.set(i, pi);
    const uint32_t w = i >> 6, b = i & 63, bit = 1u << b;
    if (mat != MAT_AIR) occ[w] |=  (uint64_t)bit; else occ[w] &= ~((uint64_t)bit);
    // update fluid/granular bitsets similarly
    dirty_mesh = true;
  }

  uint16_t get_material(int x,int y,int z) const {
    const uint32_t i = lindex(x,y,z);
    return palette[ indices.get(i) ];
  }
};
```

### Delta store (sparse edits)

```cpp
struct LocalDelta { uint32_t idx; VoxelState v; }; // idx = local 0..(64^3-1)
struct ChunkDelta {
  std::vector<LocalDelta> cells; // small, sparse list
};
struct DeltaStore {
  struct Key { int32_t cx, cy, cz; bool operator==(const Key& o) const {
    return cx==o.cx && cy==o.cy && cz==o.cz; } };
  struct KeyHash { size_t operator()(const Key& k) const {
    uint64_t h = (uint64_t)(uint32_t)k.cx * 0x9E3779B185EBCA87ull;
    h ^= (uint64_t)(uint32_t)k.cy + 0x9E3779B185EBCA87ull + (h<<6) + (h>>2);
    h ^= (uint64_t)(uint32_t)k.cz + 0x9E3779B185EBCA87ull + (h<<6) + (h>>2);
    return (size_t)h;
  }};
  std::unordered_map<Key, ChunkDelta, KeyHash> map;
};
```

### Simulation island (dense box, GPU‑resident)

```cpp
struct Island {
  Int3 origin_vox;   // world voxel coords of (0,0,0) corner
  Int3 dim;          // e.g., (160,160,160) at 10 cm
  // GPU buffers (SSBOs)
  VkBuffer occBits;      // 1 bit per cell
  VkBuffer matIdx;       // 1 byte per cell (index into island-local palette)
  VkBuffer temp;         // 1 byte per cell
  VkBuffer velFlags;     // 1 byte per cell
  VkBuffer activeA, activeB; uint32_t activeCount;
  VkBuffer moveBuf;      // one entry per active cell
  // ...
};
```

## Toy CA kernel (Vulkan GLSL): sand + water + lava

> This is intentionally compact. It uses a **two‑phase** approach with a simple conflict rule: the **lowest “ticket” wins** per destination (ticket derived from cell index and tick). Real code should tile into shared memory and handle boundaries; this shows the gist.

### Common includes (SSBO layout)

### Pass 1: propose

```glsl
// local_size tuned later; 256 threads is fine to start
layout(local_size_x=256) in;
void main() {
  uint i = gl_GlobalInvocationID.x;
  if (i >= pc.activeCount) return;

  uint idx = active[i];
  uint m   = mat[idx];
  if (m == 0u) return; // air
  uvec3 P;
  // reconstruct 3D (cheap integer math)
  uint x = idx % pc.dim.x;
  uint y = (idx / pc.dim.x) % pc.dim.y;
  uint z = idx / (pc.dim.x * pc.dim.y);
  P = uvec3(x,y,z);

  // gravity = -Y for island-local frame (actual radial gravity handled by choosing "down" dir per island)
  ivec3 down = ivec3(0,-1,0);

  // choose desired move
  ivec3 dst = ivec3(P); // default stay
  if (m == 1u /*sand*/) {
    ivec3 cand[4] = { down, down + ivec3(-1,0,0), down + ivec3(1,0,0), down + ivec3(0,0,-1) };
    // try down, then diagonals (two axes shown)
    for (int k=0;k<4;k++) {
      ivec3 q = ivec3(P)+cand[k];
      if (!in_bounds(q)) continue;
      uint qidx = lindex(uvec3(q));
      if (!get_occ(qidx) || mat[qidx]==2u /*water: sand sinks*/) { dst = q; break; }
    }
  } else if (m == 2u /*water*/) {
    ivec3 cand[5] = { down, down+ivec3(-1,0,0), down+ivec3(1,0,0), ivec3(-1,0,0), ivec3(1,0,0) };
    for (int k=0;k<5;k++) {
      ivec3 q = ivec3(P)+cand[k];
      if (!in_bounds(q)) continue;
      uint qidx = lindex(uvec3(q));
      if (!get_occ(qidx)) { dst = q; break; }
    }
  } else if (m == 3u /*lava*/) {
    // like water but slower: only try down, else stay
    ivec3 q = ivec3(P)+down;
    if (in_bounds(q)) {
      uint qidx = lindex(uvec3(q));
      if (!get_occ(qidx)) dst = q;
    }
  } else {
    return;
  }

  uint dstIdx = lindex(uvec3(dst));
  uint ticket = (pc.tick * 73856093u) ^ (idx * 19349663u); // quick hash
  moves[i] = uvec2(dstIdx, ticket);
}
```

### Pass 2: commit (+ basic reactions)

```glsl
layout(local_size_x=256) in;
void main() {
  uint i = gl_GlobalInvocationID.x;
  if (i >= pc.activeCount) return;

  uint srcIdx = active[i];
  uvec2 mv = moves[i];
  uint dstIdx = mv.x;
  uint ticket = mv.y;
  uint m = mat[srcIdx];

  if (dstIdx == srcIdx || m==0u) return;

  // Claim destination (lowest ticket wins)
  uint prev = atomicMin(claim[dstIdx], ticket);
  bool win = (ticket <= prev);

  if (win) {
    // Reactions: lava+water -> stone
    uint dm = mat[dstIdx];
    if ((m==3u && dm==2u) || (m==2u && dm==3u)) {
      // place stone at dst, leave air at src
      mat[dstIdx] = 4u; set_occ(dstIdx, true);
      mat[srcIdx] = 0u; set_occ(srcIdx, false);
      return;
    }
    // Swap with water if sand moving into water
    if (m==1u && dm==2u) {
      mat[dstIdx] = 1u; // sand
      mat[srcIdx] = 2u; // water
      set_occ(dstIdx, true);
      set_occ(srcIdx, true);
      return;
    }
    // Regular move into empty
    if (!get_occ(dstIdx)) {
      mat[dstIdx] = m; set_occ(dstIdx, true);
      mat[srcIdx] = 0u; set_occ(srcIdx, false);
      return;
    }
  }
  // Loser or blocked: keep active for next tick
  // nextActive append would go here (use atomic counter)
}
```

> Notes
> • In real code, **initialize `claim[]` each tick to 0xFFFFFFFF** (e.g., via a clear pass).
> • Use **shared memory tiles (8×8×8)**: load mat/occ into `shared` arrays, operate entirely there, then commit to global to reduce bandwidth.
> • Add **checkerboard parity** (even/odd based on (x+y+z+tick)&1) to reduce livelock.
> • Add a **nextActive** queue with an atomic pointer to schedule neighbors of any cell that moved (and cells that lost a claim).

## World ↔ island integration (practical loop)

1. **Detect activity triggers** (player dig/place, material source, slope failure) → request/expand an island centered at that area.
2. **Bake‑in**: sample base+delta into island buffers (GPU copy via staging).
3. **Simulate K ticks** (limited per frame or until island calm).
4. **Bake‑out**: diff against previous snapshot → write small set of changed cells into the **DeltaStore**; mark chunks dirty → re‑mesh (compute or CPU).
5. **Retire** island if calm for N ticks; otherwise migrate/grow it if the frontier is active.

---

## File formats (lean, versioned)

**Region file** (`.rgn`), per cube‑sphere face:

```
Header {
  char magic[4] = "RGN1";
  uint32 version;
  int32 face;      // 0..5 cube face
  int32 faceOriginChunkX, faceOriginChunkY; // face-local chunk grid origin
}
Directory[1024] for 32×32 chunks {
  uint32 offset;   // 4KB sectors from file start
  uint32 length;   // in bytes
  uint32 mtime;    // unix time
}
ChunkBlob (zstd):
{
  ChunkHeader { int16 cx, cy, cz; uint8 bpp; uint16 paletteCount; }
  palette[paletteCount] : uint16
  indices : packed bits (bpp ∈ {1,2,4,8})
  occBits : ceil(64^3 / 8) bytes
  classBits (fluid/granular) : optional
}
```

**Delta journal** (`.dlt`):

```
Header "DLT1", version, seed
Entries: [ ChunkKey, count, {localIdx, mat, temp, flags} * count ]
// Periodically compact into the region chunk blobs.
```

---

## Performance checklist (per milestone)

* Use **indirect draws** and **persistent mapped** buffers for mesh streaming.
* Batch chunk meshes per material to reduce binds.
* Keep **CA active set** small: promote to active only changed cells and their neighborhood.
* In compute, prefer **SoA** layouts and **shared memory** tiles.
* Use **async compute** queue for CA; render on graphics queue; synchronize with timeline semaphores.

---

## What to implement next (short path)

1. **Phases 1–3** to get a navigable, chunked planet with greedy meshing (no CA).
2. **Phase 4** to persist edits.
3. **Phases 5–6** to bring up the first simulation island with sand+water.
4. **Phase 7** for lava/fire and reactions.
5. **Phase 8** for refinement bubbles (5 cm/2.5 cm).
6. **Phase 9** for far‑field visuals.

I can turn any of these phases into a **week-by-week task list** with specific classes, API calls, and unit tests. If you want, I’ll also sketch the **Vulkan descriptor set layouts** and a **tiny C++ driver** that records the two compute passes for the CA and presents timing queries so you can profile immediately.
