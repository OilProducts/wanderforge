# Wanderforge

An experimental game project in early planning. The original LLM-aided planning document has been preserved as `ROADMAP.md`. This `README` will be the entry point as the codebase takes shape.

## Status

- Pre-production. No runnable code yet.

## What’s Here

- `ROADMAP.md`: The detailed planning/roadmap document that guided the initial direction (kept intact).
- `README.md`: This file. A concise overview that will grow with the project.

## Project Goals (early sketch)

- Explore a walkable, streamable planetary sandbox with simulation “islands”.
- Start small, ship vertical slices, and iterate pragmatically.
- Keep performance and memory budgets front-and-center.

See `ROADMAP.md` for the deeper technical direction and phased plan. All details are subject to change as implementation begins.

## Getting Started

There’s no build or run flow yet. As the implementation starts, this section will cover:

- Prerequisites and toolchains
- Build and run commands
- Project layout and conventions

## Contributing

Early days—no external contributions yet. Feedback and ideas are welcome; issues can be used to capture discussion once the repository structure is in place.

## License

TBD.
